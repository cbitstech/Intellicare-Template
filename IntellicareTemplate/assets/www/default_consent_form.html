		<p><em>Thank you for your interest in Intellicare. We require that you read and sign the following consent form before using the application.</em></p>

		<h4>Purpose/Introduction</h4>

		<p>You are being asked to take part in a research study. This document has important information about the reason for the study, what you will do if you choose to be in this research study, and the way we (i.e., Northwestern University) would like to use information about you and your health.</p>

		<h4>What is the reason for doing this study?</h4>

		<p>This study is being conducted by David C. Mohr, Ph.D. from the Northwestern University Department of Preventive Medicine at the Feinberg School of Medicine, and aims to create a mobile phone intervention that utilizes "machine learning" to provide care for depression.  Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, is a computer technology where a program learns from data collected continuously from patients, and then generates automated ways to help patients. The intervention, referred to as IntelliCare, can use the computer and data collected to tailor treatment content and send messages to motivate patients. The purpose of this study is to obtain preliminary information about the look and feel of IntelliCare, as well as information about its functions.</p>

		<p>You are asked to take part in this study because you are 19 years of age or older and are interested in using and providing feedback about a mobile phone intervention for depression and anxiety.</p>
	
		<h4>What you will do if you choose to be in this study?</h4>

		<p>After the IntelliCare application is downloaded on your mobile device, we will initially ask you to complete a brief series of questionnaires. These will include questions about your background (age, race gender, level of education), your mood and your interest in downloading the application. The questionnaires will take about 5 minutes to complete.</p>

		<p>Following the questionnaires, you will be able to try out a test version of an IntelliCare application.  As you use the application, we will ask you to rate your level of satisfaction and offer suggestions for improvement.</p>

		<p>Whether or not you choose to use the phone application is completely up to you. Study staff may contact you by phone or email as you use the phone application, to ensure it is working properly, ask for feedback about functions of the mobile phone application, and suggest possible changes.</p>

		<h4>What are some of the risks and discomforts that may happen to people who are in this study?</h4>

		<p>The risks from completing the questionnaires are minimal, but it is possible that you may experience emotional discomfort or increased anxiety as a result of answering questions about your mental health or reactions to the materials.  You have the option of stopping at any time.</p>

		<h4>What are some of the benefits that are likely to come from my being in this study?</h4>

		<p>The possible benefits to you from this study include helping to shape a new intervention for people experiencing depression.  Taking part in this study may help scientists to better understand how to treat depression using new technologies.</p>

		<h4>Are there any financial costs to being in this study?</h4>

		<p>There will be no costs to you for being in this study.</p>

		<h4>Will I receive payment for participation in this study?</h4>

		<p>You will not be compensated for using the IntelliCare application(s).</p>
