		<h4>Title: Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (Beta Testing)</h4>
                      
		<p>Principal Investigator: David C. Mohr, Ph.D.</p> 

		<p>Funded by: National Institute of Mental Health</p>

		<h4>Introduction</h4>

		<p>You are being asked to take part in a research study. This document has important information about the reason for the study, what you will do if you choose to be in this research study, and the way we (i.e., Northwestern University) would like to use information about you and your health.</p>

		<p><strong>What is the reason for doing this study?</strong></p>

		<p>This study is being conducted by David C. Mohr, Ph.D. from the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Feinberg School of Medicine, and aims to create a mobile phone intervention that utilizes "machine learning" to provide care for depression.  Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, is a computer technology where a program learns from data collected continuously from patients, and then generate automated ways to help patients. The intervention, referred to as IntelliCare, can use the computer and data collected to tailor treatment content and send messages to motivate patients. The purpose of this study is to obtain preliminary information about the look and feel of IntelliCare, as well as information about its functions.</p>

		<p>You are asked to take part in this study because you are 18 years of age or older and are interested in providing feedback about a mobile phone intervention for depression.</p>

		<p><strong>What you will do if you choose to be in this study?</strong></p>

		<p>In order to determine whether you are eligible for the study, we may initially ask you to complete a telephone interview and a series of questionnaires. These will include questions about your mood. The interview will take approximately 30-60 minutes, and the questionnaires will take about 30-60 minutes. We ask that you complete the questionnaires as close to the day of your telephone interview as possible. They will be available to you on the Internet through a secure link.</p>  

		<p>If you are determined to be eligible and choose to participate, you may be asked to participate in an in-person feedback session where you may be invited to the CBITs Research Lab at Northwestern University (680 N. Lakeshore Drive, Suite 1400, Chicago, IL. 60611) to provide feedback regarding materials and functions on the website and/or mobile phone application and suggest possible changes. You may also be able to participant in this without coming into the office.</p>

		<p>During this feedback session, you will be asked to review a paper prototype or a test version of the website and/or application, and "think aloud" to share your thoughts about the materials you are viewing. You may also complete an interview with a research staff member about your opinions of the materials. You will be videotaped during this procedure so researchers can keep track of your thoughts as well as observe the way in which you use the prototypes. Videotaping is required for you to participate in this study. This information will be used to make improvements to the content, look and feel, and function of the mobile phone application and website. The session may last up to two hours.</p>

		<p>If you own a compatible smartphone, you might be given the option to use some of the phone components for 1 to 2 weeks. This would allow you to try out the test version of the phone application in your daily life, and on your own phone. Whether or not you are given this option, and for how long, will depend on information we receive from you or other participants and current needs of the study. Whether or not you choose to use the phone application is completely up to you. Study staff may contact you by phone or email as you use the phone application, to ensure it is easy to use and working properly.</p> 

		<p><strong>What are some of the risks and discomforts that may happen to people who are in this study?</strong></p>

		<p>The risks from completing the self-report measures and interviews are minimal, but it is possible that you may experience emotional discomfort or increased anxiety as a result of answering questions about your mental health or reactions to the materials.  You have the option of stopping at any time.</p> 

		<p><strong>What are some of the benefits for Me or Others?</strong></p>
  
		<p>The possible benefits to you from this study include helping to shape a new intervention for people experiencing depression.  Taking part in this study may help scientists to better understand how to treat depression using new technologies.</p>

		<p><strong>What other procedures or courses of treatment might be available to me?</strong></p>
		   
		<p>You do not have to take part in this research study.  Instead of being this study, you can seek out alternative services for the treatment of depression.</p>

		<p><strong>Are there any financial costs to being in this study?</strong></p> 

		<p>There will be no costs to you for being in this study.</p> 

		<p><strong>Will I receive payment for participation in this study?</strong></p>    

		<p>You will receive $20 for completing the questionnaires and interviews needed to determine your eligibility for this study.</p> 

		<p>If you download the app to your personal phone, you will be compensated based on the number of in-phone assessment "pings" completed, receiving $0.50 for each assessment, for a total of up to $35 per week (up to 10 pings per day, 7 days per week).  You will also receive $15 per weekly phone interview, for a total of up to $45 additional.   If we invite you to our lab to complete a 2 hour laboratory-based individual usability testing session on IntelliCare, you will be paid $50 for this lab session.</p>

		<p>Payment will be made by check and typically takes about 3-4 weeks to process. The Accounting Services at Northwestern University will be given your name, address, and Social Security Number in order to issue a check for your study participation. Study payments are considered taxable income and reportable to the IRS. A Form 1099 will be sent to you if your total payments are $600 or more in a calendar year.</p>

		<p>Payment may also be made through a prepaid debit card, pending on whether it is available at the time of your participation. If the debit card is available at the time of your participation, you may still opt to be paid by check if that is your preferred method of payment. The prepaid debit card should be considered the same as cash; if you lose it, it cannot be replaced or tracked. The card does not require any activation or registration; it will be ready to be used when it is issued to you. You may use the card in any store that takes Visa debit/credit cards and it may be used for any type of purchase, including food, entertainment, gas, etc. You will be asked to select "Credit" when you use it for purchases. It does not require a PIN to use for purchases. Please do not attempt to use this card at an ATM machine to withdraw cash, as fees will apply. The funds loaded on the card do not expire, however fees begin every month after 6 months of inactivity. Your name will not be on the card, nor will your information be shared with the card company. More detailed information will be supplied with the card if you choose to be paid this way.</p>
