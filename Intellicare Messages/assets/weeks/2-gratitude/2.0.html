		<h1>An Attitude of Gratitude</h1>
		
		<p>
			<em>
				"Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If 
				you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever 
				have enough."
			</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			Gratitude has two parts. First, through gratitude you affirm that 
			there are good things in the world, as well as gifts and benefits 
			that you've received. Second, you recognize that some of the sources 
			of this goodness are outside of yourself. Gratitude means 
			acknowledging that other people, or even higher powers, gave us 
			gifts, both big and small, that added goodness to your life.
