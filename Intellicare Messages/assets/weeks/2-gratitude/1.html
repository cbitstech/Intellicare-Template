			If you are like most people, you think too much about what goes 
			wrong and not enough about what goes right in your life. Of course, 
			sometimes it makes sense for us to analyze upsetting events so that 
			we can learn from them and avoid them in the future. However, people 
			tend to spend more time thinking about the negatives in life than is 
			helpful. Worse, this tendency to focus on the negative sets us up 
			for feeling anxious, sad, or irritable, and deprives us of moments 
			of joy, contentment, and happiness.
		</p>
		<p>
			One way to keep this from happening is to develop our ability to 
			think about the good parts of life. Most of us don't spend nearly as 
			much time analyzing good events as we do analyzing the events that 
			upset us! That is why this is a skill that needs practice. As you 
			become better at focusing on the good in your life, you will likely 
			become more grateful for what you have and more hopeful about the 
			future. So let's get started.
