		<h3>How to Build Gratitude?</h3>
		
		<p>
			If you have a hard time feeling or expressing gratitude, don't 
			worry. The benefits of gratitude aren't only available to people 
			with a naturally grateful disposition. Instead, feeling grateful is 
			a skill you can develop with practice, and you will receive its 
			rewards along the way.
