			Throughout the week, you'll receive instructions, advice, and 
			reminders to practice gratitude in new and different ways each day. 
			If you go through the motions and practice, the feeling of gratitude 
			will come. So try it out this week, even when you don't feel like 
			it, and notice how it changes how you feel and what you do!
