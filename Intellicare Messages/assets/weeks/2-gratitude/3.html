		<h3>Why Be Grateful?</h3>
		
		<p>
			Gratitude is good for our bodies, hearts, and minds. Gratitude is 
			associated with many social, physical, and psychological benefits.  
			These benefits are available to anyone who practices gratitude, even 
			in the middle of difficulties and struggles.  Actually, gratitude is 
			especially important when times get tough.
