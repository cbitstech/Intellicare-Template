		<h3>
			Pleasure and Accomplishment
		</h3>
		
		<p>
			Positive activities are things that make you feel good. There are 
			two types: Activities that bring you pleasure and those that give 
			you a sense of accomplishment. Both activities are equally important 
			in improving how you feel!
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Pleasurable activities are those that bring a sense of happiness or 
			contentment simply from doing them.  Spending time with friends or 
			working on a favorite hobby are examples of pleasurable activities.
		</p>

		<p>
			Accomplishment activities are those that bring a sense of 
			achievement or control over your life. Accomplishment is that 
			feeling you get when you finish something, whether it's something 
			big or something small. Accomplishment can come from something as 
			simple as making a really great cup of coffee or something bigger, 
			like finishing some home repairs.  Crossing things off your to-do 
			list, like finishing chores, doing the laundry, or paying bills are 
			often great ways to get a sense of accomplishment.
