			What you do affects how you feel.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Doing more positive activities can make you feel more positive, give 
			you a break from your problems and worries, and help you become more 
			physically healthy.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			When you are feeling down, stressed out, or anxious, you might do 
			fewer positive activities. This is because feeling down, leads to 
			less interest or motivation to do things, or maybe because the 
			things you used to enjoy just don't sound as good.  Also, being 
			stressed out or anxious can make you think that you don't have time 
			to do the things that help you to recharge mentally and physically.
