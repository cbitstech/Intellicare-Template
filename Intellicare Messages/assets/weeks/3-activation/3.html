		<h3>
			Improving Your Life Through Positive Activities
		</h3>
		
		<p>
			Getting more active is one way to improve your life. Try scheduling 
			and doing something each day this week that is pleasurable or that 
			gives you a sense of accomplishment.  Throughout the week you'll get 
			instructions, advice, and reminders to do more positive activities 
			each day, and to plan and schedule activities to make it more likely 
			that you'll do them.
