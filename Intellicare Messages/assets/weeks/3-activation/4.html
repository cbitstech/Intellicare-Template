			Sometimes it's Hard to do Positive Things
		</h3>
		
		<p>
			It is important to learn to do positive things even when you don't 
			feel like it. Try acting like you would if you were feeling good, 
			rather than acting how you actually feel. Waiting until you feel 
			like doing a positive activity won't help you have control over how 
			you feel.  Doing positive activities even when you don't feel like 
			it is what will improve your mood.  Action before motivation!
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Pleasurable activities are those that bring a sense of happiness or 
			contentment simply from doing them.  Spending time with friends or 
			working on a favorite hobby are examples of pleasurable activities.

			Accomplishment activities are those that bring a sense of 
			achievement or control over your life. Accomplishment is that 
			feeling you get when you finish something, whether it's something 
			big or something small. Accomplishment can come from something as 
			simple as making a really great cup of coffee or something bigger, 
			like finishing some home repairs.  Crossing things off your to-do 
			list, like finishing chores, doing the laundry, or paying bills are 
			often great ways to get a sense of accomplishment.
