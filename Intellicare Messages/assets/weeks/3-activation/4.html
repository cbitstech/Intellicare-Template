		<h1>Accomplishment Activities</h1>

		<p>
			Accomplishment activities are those that bring a sense of 
			achievement or control over your life. Accomplishment is that 
			feeling you get when you finish something, whether it's something 
			big or something small. Accomplishment can come from something as 
			simple as making a really great cup of coffee or something bigger, 
			like finishing some home repairs.  Crossing things off your to-do 
			list, like finishing chores, doing the laundry, or paying bills are 
			often great ways to get a sense of accomplishment.
