		<h3>
			Sometimes it's Hard to do Positive Things
		</h3>
		
		<p>
			It is important to learn to do positive things even when you don't 
			feel like it. Try acting like you would if you were feeling good, 
			rather than acting how you actually feel. Waiting until you feel 
			like doing a positive activity won't help you have control over how 
			you feel.  Doing positive activities even when you don't feel like 
			it is what will improve your mood.  Action before motivation!
