			<strong>Step 2:  E</strong>valuate each possible solution. Choose a solution that 
			helps you reach your goal and has the least unwanted consequences or 
			costs.

				Hint: Some solutions could make you feel uncomfortable just 
				because they would require you to try something new.  Please 
				don't write off solutions for that reason. <strong> Stepping out of your 
				"comfort zone" can be a sign that you're on the right track </strong>to 
				taking more control of your life!
