			The BET strategy stands for:
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Step 1: Brainstorm all possible solutions to the problem.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<em>
				Hint: List every option &emdash; whether or not you think the 
				solution is good or bad, and no matter how ridiculous or crazy
				the solution sounds!
			</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			Step 2:  Evaluate each possible solution. Choose a solution that 
			helps you reach your goal and has the least unwanted consequences or 
			costs.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<em>
				Hint: Some solutions could make you feel uncomfortable just 
				because they would require you to try something new.  Please 
				don't write off solutions for that reason.  Stepping out of your 
				"comfort zone" can be a sign that you're on the right track to 
				taking more control of your life!
			</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			Step 3: Try out the best solution! Pick a time when you will test 
			out the solution. If the first solution does not work, repeat the 
			BET steps and try the next best solution.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<em>
				Hint: Commit to a day and time when you will try out the 
				solution.
			</em>
		</p>
