		<h3>Rethinking Thinking (Challenging Negative Thoughts)</h3> 
		
		<p>
			Just because you have a negative thought, doesn't mean you have to 
			listen to it or agree with it.  You can "rethink" those negative 
			thoughts by coming up with new "alternative" thoughts that give you 
			a different perspective.  One way to do that is to ask yourself some 
			questions about the negative thought:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Are there any other explanations?
			</li>
			<li>
				Have I had any experiences that show this thought is not 100% 
				true all the time?
			</li>
			<li>
				What value is there in holding on to this rule?  Does this rule 
				help me or others?
			</li>
			<li>
				Is it possible I'm blowing this out of proportion? What is a 
				more reasonable way to look at this?
			</li>
			<li>
				Have I oversimplified the issue? What is a less emotional 
				description of the problem?
			</li>
			<li>
				What is my role in this situation? Have I assigned all the blame 
				to others?
			</li>
			<li>
				If I believe this thought, what will happen?  How will I feel?
			</li>
			<li>
				What could be the effect of thinking about this differently?
			</li>
			<li>
				If my best friend was in the situation and had this thought, 
				what would I tell him/her?
			</li>
		</ul>
