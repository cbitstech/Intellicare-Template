			Often, when people come up with new ways of thinking about a 
			stressful situation, they don't always believe it 100%.  That's OK.  
			Practice coming up with new, more helpful "alternative" thoughts, 
			and you will improve.  It's a skill like any other. Once you learn 
			it, you will become more resilient to stress!
		</p>

			For the next week, take a little time each day to look at your 
			negative automatic thoughts and thought patterns, and try to come up 
			with alternative, more helpful thoughts.  It's best to start by 
			writing them down until you get the hang of it, and can do it in 
			your head.
