		<ul>
			<li>
				My boss got mad at me for not doing a job right.

		<ul>
			<li>
				I never do anything right. I'm going to get fired.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Negative Thought Pattern</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Discounting the positive.
			</li>
			<li>
				Catastrophizing.
			</li>
		</ul>


		<p>New, "Alternative" Thoughts</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				I've done a lot of things well.
			</li>
			<li>
				Maybe there is something I can learn from this.
			</li>
			<li>
				I've been at this job for a long time, and he didn't mention 
				firing me. And even if he did, I could find another job.
			</li>
		</ul>
