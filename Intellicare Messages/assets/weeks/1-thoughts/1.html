			This week is about helping you rethink negative thought patterns.  
			The way we think affects how we feel.  For example, if a friend 
			gets angry with you, and you think, "Oh no, I'm going to lose this 
			friend," you'd likely feel sad or anxious.  If your thought was, 
			"This person always gets angry, and never understands me," you 
			might feel angry.  But what if, instead, you thought, "This person 
			has a lot going on and is probably stressed"?  You'd probably not 
			feel bad at all, and might even feel sympathetic. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Everyone has negative thoughts during stressful or challenging 
			situations. These thoughts are often "automatic," which means that 
			they just pop into our heads.  Sometimes we are barely aware of 
			them!
