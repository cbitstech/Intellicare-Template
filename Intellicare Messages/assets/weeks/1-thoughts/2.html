			The trouble is, negative thoughts are often exaggerated or even 
			inaccurate.  They don't point towards a solution, and often they 
			stop you from moving forward.  When we have these negative 
			thoughts over and over, it can affect our general mood, making us 
			feel sad, unmotivated, anxious, irritable, ashamed, or bad in other 
			ways.

			We will show you some ways of recognizing negative thought patterns and learn to think more flexibly. This will reduce the upsetting feelings that come from negative thoughts.  There are three steps:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Notice negative automatic thoughts </li>
			<li>See if there is a pattern</li> 
			<li>Come up "alternative thoughts" that are more helpful, and do not leave you with bad feelings</li>
		</ol>
