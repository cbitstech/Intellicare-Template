		<h3>Common Negative Thought Patterns</h3> 
		<ul>
			<li>
				"Shoulds": Thoughts about how you or other people "should" be 
				can lead to guilt, anger, or shame. They also don't help you 
				think about how to fix a problem.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Example: "I should be better at..."
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Dwelling on the negative/discounting the positive: you single 
				out only the negative details, or discount the positive, so 
				your reality becomes darkened.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Example: If someone rejects you, you think to yourself, 
						"Nobody likes me."
					</li>
					<li>
						Example: If someone compliments you, you think, "She's 
						just saying that to be nice."
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Catastrophizing: Exaggerating the importance of problems.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Example:  "My boss got mad at me - he's going fire me."
					</li>
					<li>
						Example: "If I split up with my partner, I'll never 
						meet anyone again, and will be alone."
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Overgeneralizing: Seeing a single negative event as a never 
				ending pattern (often using words like "always" or "never").
				<ul>
					<li>
						Example: After an awkward social moment, you think, 
						"I never know what to say to people."
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Magical Thinking: You make assumptions about what others are 
				thinking (like a mind reader) or about what the future holds 
				(like a psychic).
				<ul>
					<li>
						Example: "I know exactly what she's thinking."
					</li>
					<li>
						Example: "If I say that, I know he'll get mad."
					</li>
					<li>
						Example: "He did that on purpose."
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Some of these negative thought patterns overlap.  As you begin to 
			pay attention to negative automatic thoughts, the goal is to see 
			which patterns fit for you.
