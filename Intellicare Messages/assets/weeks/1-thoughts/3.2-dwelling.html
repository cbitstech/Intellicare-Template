		<h1>Negative Thought Pattern #2</h1> 
			
		<p>
			<strong>Dwelling on the negative/discounting the positive</strong>: you single 
			out only the negative details, or discount the positive, so 
			your reality becomes darkened.
			<ul>
				<li>
					Example: If someone rejects you, you think to yourself, 
					"Nobody likes me."
				</li>
				<li>
					Example: If someone compliments you, you think, "She's 
					just saying that to be nice."
				</li>
			</ul>
