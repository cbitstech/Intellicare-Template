		<h3>Negative Thought Pattern #5</h3> 
		<ul>
			
				<strong>Magical Thinking</strong>: You make assumptions about what others are 
				thinking (like a mind reader) or about what the future holds 
				(like a psychic).
				<ul>
					<li>
						Example: "I know exactly what she's thinking."
					</li>
					<li>
						Example: "If I say that, I know he'll get mad."
					</li>
					<li>
						Example: "He did that on purpose."
					</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Some of these negative thought patterns overlap.  As you begin to 
			pay attention to negative automatic thoughts, the goal is to see 
			which patterns fit for you.
