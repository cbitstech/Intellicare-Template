			Other people matter. Human beings are social creatures. Our 
			interactions with other people have strong influences on how we 
			feel. Also, when we're feeling down, stressed out, or anxious, it 
			can change the way we interact with people. We might isolate 
			ourselves and have fewer positive interpersonal interactions.
