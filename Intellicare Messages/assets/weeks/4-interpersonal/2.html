		<h3>Break the Cycle: Increasing Interpersonal Interactions</h3>
		<p>
			When we feel down, we are less likely to socialize. As our mood 
			drops, we do even fewer things with people. This continues until we 
			are feeling so bad that we spend much of our time feeling alone. We 
			can break this cycle by having more positive interactions with other 
			people. This includes increasing the number of positive interactions 
			or taking neutral interactions and changing them into positive ones.
