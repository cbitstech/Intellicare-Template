		<h3>More Positive Interactions</h3>
		<p>
			One way to reduce isolation and increase the amount of positive 
			interactions with other people is to engage in more activities. This 
			includes planning activities with people we know, finding ways to 
			meet new people, or just getting out of the house and out to places 
			where other people are. Just being around other people can sometimes 
			help us feel a little more like we're in the stream of life.
