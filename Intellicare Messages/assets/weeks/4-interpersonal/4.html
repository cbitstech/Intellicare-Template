		<h3>Changing Neutral to Positive Interactions</h3>
		<p>
			You might find that you're life already fills packed and there's no 
			way you can think of adding more things to do. You can still 
			increase the number of positive interactions in your life. One way 
			to do this is to take opportunities to turn neutral, maybe everyday 
			interactions, into something positive. This includes chatting 
			pleasantly with the cashier when you check out at the store, sharing 
			a smile with a passerby on the street or a bus, or having a positive 
			exchange with a co-worker. Changing neutral to positive interactions 
			can sometimes help us feel a little more connected with others and 
			increases positive emotions.
