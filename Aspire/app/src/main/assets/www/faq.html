            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>How do I add paths to a value?</h4>

                <h4>Why are there faces along the bottom of the home screen? Some of them are smiling and some are not. What do they mean?</h4>
                <p>The faces indicate if you have checked off any paths that day. Tapping on a smiling face will allow you to see all of the paths that you completed on that day/
                If you had not checked off any paths for any values, you will see "No paths recorded this day..."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Does a neutral face mean I should set up new paths or can I do ones that I have already set up?</h4>
                <p>To cause the faces to smile, check off paths that you have followed for each virtue using the "check in" button.</p>
            </li>

            <li>

                your comments, type away, and send it off.</p>
