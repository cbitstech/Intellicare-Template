    <h1>What might get in the way of using Aspire?</h1>
		<p>You might not have thought a lot about your values and what you can do to live those values in your daily life.
            That's okay, we've included some examples of values as well as things that people say they do that are associated with each of those values.
            You can use ours to start, and try creating your own after you've used Aspire for a few days.
            You can also ask other people about what their values are or what they might do to live a value that
            you have identified is important for you. Some people feel that it takes a lot of time to live their values,
            so they end up doing nothing. We'd recommend that you try to think of a few "smaller" paths if necessary so you have some things you can do each day.
            Living your values doesn't have to be about just the big things.</p>
            <p>You might also forget that you have Aspire on your phone, so it's useful to schedule notifications for reminders to do your "paths" and review your values.  </p>
