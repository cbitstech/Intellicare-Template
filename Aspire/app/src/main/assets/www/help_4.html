    <h1>How often to use Aspire</h1>
		<p>You should check in with Aspire each day.
            In Aspire you'll check in when you complete a "path" related to one of your values and if you don't enter it,
            Aspire won't be able to keep track of your progress.
            You don't need to check in with Aspire right after you do a "path" related to one of your values, but you should take some time each day to reflect back on the day.
            The important thing is to make this part of your daily ritual.
            And as you learn to live your values, your life will become fuller, richer, and more meaningful.
            If you need help remembering to do this, Aspire lets you set notifications for a daily reminder to do your "paths" and a reminder to review your values.  </p>
