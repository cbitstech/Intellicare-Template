    <h1>How to use Aspire</h1>
		<p>In Aspire, you will first be given a list of possible values that people like you have given us and asked which ones apply to you.
            You can also add your own value if it's not included on the list.
            Then you will specify some "paths" or activities that you can engage in that help you live that value.
            Again, we'll give you some suggestions that people have found useful, but please create your own, as these will hold more meaning.
            The paths we've suggested are somewhat general, but when you create your own paths it helps them be as personal for you possible. </p>
           <p> As you complete these paths each day you can log that in the Aspire app and it will keep track of your progress overtime.
               If you completed a path on each day a smiley face will indicate that on the home screen.
               You can always try new values and paths.
               Exploring different values and paths will help you find what your most important values are â€“
               the ones that give you a sense of satisfaction and purpose.
               You can set an image to be associated with each of your values from the home screen.
               If you have more questions about using Aspire, you can read the FAQ section within the app. </p>
