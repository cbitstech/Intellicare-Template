		<p>You’ll start out by selecting a value that is meaningful to you. We’ll provide a list of 20 values, some of which might apply to you, but you can create your own value as well.</p>
        <p>Then you will specify some “paths” or activities that you can engage in that support that value.
            Again, we’ll give you some suggestions, but please create your own as these will hold more meaning.
            The paths we’ve suggested are somewhat general, but when you create your own paths it helps for them to be as specific as possible.</p>
        <p>As you complete these paths each day you can log that in the Aspire app and it will keep track of your progress overtime.
            If you completed a path on each day a smiley face will indicate that on the home screen. </p>
