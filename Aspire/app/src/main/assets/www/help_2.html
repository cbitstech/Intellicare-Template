    <h1>How Can Aspire Help Me?</h1>
		<p>Aspire can help you by clearly identifying what your personal values are and things you can do that help you live those values (called "paths").
            You can use Aspire to track your completion of these "paths" and gain more awareness
            of the effort you put into living your values. Aspire can also send you reminders to do these "paths" and ways to
            see which "paths" and values you have been putting the most time and effort into.  </p>
