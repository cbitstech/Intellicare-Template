    <h1>What might get in the way of using iCope?</h1>
		<p>It is often difficult to come up with Coping Reminders at first.
            It might be useful to ask friends or other people you trust for coping advice and what they might do in that difficult or stressful situation.
            Some general coping skills, like taking some deep breaths and relaxing, might be useful in lots of situations,
            so focus on what works for you in some situations and try them in other situations too.
            Some situations may be so stressful or difficult that it's hard to think how you would manage it. </p>

    <p> People tell us it is best not to start with the MOST stressful or difficult situation.
            It is easier to start by practicing your coping skill with smaller, more predictable,
            or more manageable situations first, and then to work your way up to larger, less predictable,
            or more difficult situations as you get better. iCope also works best when reminders are scheduled
            so you don't have to use the app and find the right reminder for the situation you're in,
            so try and take some time each day to review the app and schedule reminders. </p>
