    <h1>How to use iCope</h1>
		<p>In iCope you will be able to create Coping Reminders and schedule these reminders at particular times.
            Each Coping Reminder contains a description of stressful or difficult situation or event, a tag categorizing that event,
            and a management plan about what you want to do or say to yourself in that situation.
            You can write Coping Reminders for both events you can plan for or for events that you know might happen but are not sure when they will happen. </p>

            <p>
            Scheduling reminders is useful for events that you can plan for and iCope will send you that reminder at the time you scheduled it.
            At other times, when difficult or stressful situations come up, you can look for useful Coping Reminders that you created in the iCope library.
            If you have more questions about using iCope, you can read the FAQ section within the app.  </p>
