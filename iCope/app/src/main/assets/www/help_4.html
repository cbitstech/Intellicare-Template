    <h1>How often to use iCope</h1>
		<p>You can use iCope in a variety of ways. The first time you use it, you can think about the next few days and write
            Coping Reminders for any stressful or difficult situations you might encounter
            (for example, a difficult conversation, something you need to get done but often avoid).
            Each day, it's useful to take some time and plan for the upcoming day.
            You can review the reminders you've scheduled, create and schedule new reminders,
            or schedule reminders youâ€™ve used before that worked really well. It's best to use the app each day even if you don't have any new reminders scheduled.  </p>
