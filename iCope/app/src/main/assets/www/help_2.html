    <h1>How can iCope help me?</h1>
		<p>iCope can help you by being better prepared to handle stressful situations and creating a library of coping reminders that
            will contain strategies you come up with to act and think more effectively in those situations.
            Over time this can reduce your stress and boost your mood.  </p>
