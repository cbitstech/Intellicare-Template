                <b>When adding a new card, what is the difference between the first two questions: “What kind of event is this?” and “What is the important situation or event?"</b>
				<p>"Kind of event" assigns a category - such as a work event, or a family event.
                    Later, in the "library," you will be able to sort your cards by event type. The second question asks you to describe the scenario which is causing you stress or anxiety.</p>
			</li>

            <li>
                <b>When adding a new card, the third question asks "What do you want to remind yourself of when this happens?" When what happens?</b>
                <p>The reminder is intended to help you calm down before a stressful event or situation. You can choose your own words that will help dispel emotional or stress-based thoughts.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>How do I schedule the time and date for this reminder?</b>
                <p>After you finish the initial questions, a popup window will display to allow you to schedule the reminder time.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b> How do I save the card?</b>
                <p>Press the floppy disc "save" icon in the upper right corner of the app.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>What if I want to cancel the card I am currently creating?</b>
                <p>Press the Android system “back” arrow in your device’s navigation screen.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>When should I add new cards?</b>
                <p>When you are worried about an upcoming event or situation and you want a reminder of how to manage your stress.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>How do I review old cards?</b>
                <p>Go to the Card Library by tapping the “book” icon at the top of the home screen. This will show you all your cards. You can hold the card to bring up the edit menu.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Will all of my cards always be on the home screen of the app?</b>
                <p>No, the home screen only shows you upcoming reminders to help you cope with stressful events.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>What is the difference between the Card Library and the home screen in iCope?</b>
                <p>The home screen is your schedule of reminders, while the library shows you all your cards.
                    Since you can schedule multiple reminders for one card, you edit reminders from the home screen.
                    Deleting one reminder won't delete all the reminders for the card, just the one at that time. To delete the whole card go to the library.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Is there anything else I am suppose to do?</b>
                <p>At times you will be asked to rate a reminder, after the event has happened. You can report if the reminder was helpful or unhelpful.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>What if I forget how to use iCope? Where can I find instructions to help me?</b>
                <p>You can review the introductory content by hitting the settings button in the upper right hand corner of the main screen.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>How can I send the developers feedback?</b>
                <p>After pressing the settings button in the top right corner of the main screen, select 'Send Feedback.' This will allow you to email the developers.</p>
            </li>
