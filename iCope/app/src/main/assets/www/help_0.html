		<h1>Welcome to "iCope"</h1>
		
        <p>We're often not at our best when we're stressed out.
            How many times have you walked away from a distressing situation and thought,
            "Wow, if I had a second chance I would have..."</p>
           <p> What if you could write yourself a message when you're not in a stressful situation that would get sent to you when you need it?
            iCope helps you do that by letting you create automated reminders for particular situations with your own management plans to handle that situation. </p>
