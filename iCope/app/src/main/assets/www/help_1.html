    <h1>Creating Reminders</h1>
		<p>In iCope you will be able to create Coping Reminders and schedule your phone to send you these reminders at particular times.
            Because we often face similar situations in our lives you can save, edit, and re-use Coping Reminders that you previously created
            and found helpful. You can label your reminders with tags such as "work" or "social" to make them easier to find later.</p>

            <p>Each Coping Reminder contains a description of distressing situation or event, a tag categorizing that event,
            and a management plan about what you want to do or say to yourself in that situation.
            You can then schedule the Coping Reminder to be sent to you at a particular time. The reminder will appear in your phone notification tray, the way a text message does. </p>

            <p>The main screen of the app will display your upcoming coping reminders. Here, you can delete a particular reminder without deleting other reminder times for the card, if they exist. The Card Library, accessible by tapping the "book" icon, will allow you
            to add, edit, or delete cards themselves. In the Card Library, hold your finger on a card until an edit menu pops up to make changes.</p>

            <p>You can also filter your reminders by category - tapping "filter" in the Card Library will let you sort by the categories you set when creating cards.</p>
