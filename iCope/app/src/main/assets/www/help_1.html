		<p>In iCope you will be able to create Coping Reminders and schedule your phone to send you these reminders at particular times.
            Because we often face similar situations in our lives you can save, edit, and re-use Coping Reminders that you previously created
            and found helpful. Each Coping Reminder contains a description of distressing situation or event, a tag categorizing that event,
            and a management plan about what you want to do or say to yourself in that situation.
            You can then schedule the Coping Reminder to be sent to you at a particular time. </p>
