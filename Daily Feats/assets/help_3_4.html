		<p>Based on your answer to how you are feeling, Daily Feats will start you with the following list of goals:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>I accomplished something today.</li>
			<li>I enjoyed an activity today.</li>
			<li>I took care of myself.</li>
			<li>I was grateful for something.</li>
			<li>I overcame a bad habit.</li>
			<li>I strengthened a good habit.</li>
			<li>I faced something I wanted to avoid.</li>
			<li>I avoided something I wish I had faced.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Once a day, ideally at the end of the day, you will be asked to evaluate how many of these goals you completed that day.</p>

        <p>The purpose of completing this checklist is to give you an achievable set of goals to work towards, and to help you keep them in mind on a daily basis.</p>
