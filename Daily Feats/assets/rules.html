		<p>When you started using Daily Feats, you answered a questionnaire that assessed your depression level on a scale from 1 to 4 (1 = most depressed, 4 = least depressed).</p>

		<p>To advance in Daily Feats, the goal is to raise your level by completing daily feats in a consistent manner to establish a "streak".</p>
		
		<p>For a given level, there are a certain number of associated feats. If you complete more than half the feats for a given level for five (5) consecutive days, you will "level-up" and be able to work on new feats.</p>
		
		<p>However, if you don't complete more than half the feats for your level for five (5) consecutive days, your level will drop and you will need to work on the lower-level feats to resume progressing.</p>
		
		<p>Good luck working towards reaching Level 4 (and staying there)!</p>
