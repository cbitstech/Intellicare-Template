		<p>Based on your answer to how you are feeling, Daily Feats will start you with the following list of goals:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>I got out of bed.</li>
			<li>I groomed myself.</li>
			<li>I am satisfied with how I ate.</li>
			<li>I went outside.</li>
			<li>I interacted with people.</li>
			<li>I took care of my living space.</li>
			<li>I felt rested.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Once a day, ideally at the end of the day, you will be asked to evaluate how many of these goals you completed that day.</p>

        <p>The purpose of completing this checklist is to give you an achievable set of goals to work towards, and to help you keep them in mind on a daily basis.</p>
