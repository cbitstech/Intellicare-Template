			When starting a new exercise program, it is important to remember to 
			<strong>build up over time</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you have not been active for a while, start out slowly - you can 
			do three 10-minute sessions in one day, instead of all 30 minutes at 
			once, for example!  MoveME can help you gradually add more time and 
			days. Here is what we suggest:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Week 1: 50 minutes total</li>
			<li>Week 2: 100 minutes total</li>
			<li>Week 3: 150 minutes total</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			All adults should be getting, as recommended by the United States 
			Department of Health and Human services, is 30-45 minutes of 
			moderate intensity physical activity 5 days per week, or 2 hours and 
			30 minutes of aerobic physical activity total. Additionally, adults 
			should engage in strengthening activities (weights, yoga, pilates, 
			etc.) 2 times per week.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you're already exercising but want to move more, start out by 
			adding 5 minutes of activity to your routine per day, and MoveME 
			will help you increase from there - and notice your overall mood 
			increase, too!
