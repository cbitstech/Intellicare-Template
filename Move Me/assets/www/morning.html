			Here are some common motivation-sapping thoughts for morning exercise. Have you had any of these thoughts before?
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>I'll skip my workout just this one time</li> 
			<li>It is too cold to get out of bed</li>
			<li>Sleep will be better for my mood</li>
			<li>Missing my workout once won't matter</li>
			<li>I'll just turn over in bed once more</li>
			<li>10 more minutes in bed won't matter</li>
			<li>I am too tired to exercise well</li>
			<li>I can always exercise this evening</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Remind yourself of these advantages of early morning exercise:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Exercise is an excellent way to start the day</li>
			<li>Early morning time is excellent "me" time</li>
			<li>All day you get to enjoy the sense of accomplishment of having already exercised</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Remember that you made your decision to exercise when you had an AWAKE MIND the previous evening!
