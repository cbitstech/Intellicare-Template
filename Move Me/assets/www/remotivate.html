			In managing your motivation for exercise, it pays to know where your roadblocks will be. These are situations that pull for anything but exercise. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			For example, when was the last time you WANTED to be active, but the weather outside stopped you? Or you sat down to watch TV and all the sudden it was time for bed? Or you just didn’t feel like moving? These are all types of low motivation zones - and you can feel really stuck in them if you don’t know how to get yourself out!
		</p> 

		<p>Identify your LOW MOTIVATION ZONES, these might include:</p> 
		<ul>
			<li>home</li>
			<li>couch</li>
			<li>bed</li>
			<li>work</li>
			<li>office</li>
			<li>kitchen</li>
			<li>around/with a certain person</li>
			<li>morning</li>
			<li>afternoon</li>
			<li>evening</li>
			<li>bad weather</li>
			<li>bad/low mood</li>
			<li>negative self-talk - "I don't want to anymore" or "this is pointless"</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			Here are some options to LIFT YOURSELF UP from the low:
		</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Avoid the low motivation zone altogether (do not sit on the coach).</li>
			<li>Plan around low motivation zones - Schedule exercise when you are most likely to follow through. For example, if your low motivation zone is your office, scheduled some kind of physical activity in the morning, before you go to work.</li> 
			<li>Ask a friend for help - Let them know what your low motivation zones are so they can make sure you do not get stuck in them.</li>
			<li>Find balance in your activity schedule - For regular activity, it will be important to balance the TYPE of activity, the INTENSITY, and your MOTIVATION.</li> 
			<li>Schedule your activity like you would any other appointment - Consider if there is a regular time of day when it is easier to exercise or when you need the mood boost!</li>
		</ol>
