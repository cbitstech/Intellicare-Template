		<p>In addition to rewarding yourself immediately after exercise, echo 
		your success across the day and week. This includes:</p>
		
		<ol> 
			<li><p>Repetition of your I DID IT phrase.</p></li> 
			<li><p>Thinking about what was most positive about your exercise and 
			how it made (and is making) you feel. Even if you feel tired - 
			that's ok! These feelings are markers of your achievement.</p></li>
