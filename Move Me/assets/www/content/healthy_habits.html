		<p>These are all signs your new routine is becoming a habit. Keep up the 
		good work!</p>
		 
		<p><strong>Rewarding yourself</strong> after exercise will also keep you 
		motivated. This starts at the moment you finish a workout, with two 
		immediate events:</p>
		
		<ol> 
			<li>Say to yourself something like&#8230; I DID IT!</li> 
			<li>Allow yourself a satisfied smile.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>These rewards are an accurate acknowledgement of the investment you 
		just made in your well being!</p> 

		<p>You can also reward yourself with a fun activity, such as going to a 
		movie or shopping with a friend.</p>
