		<p>Outside motivators include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Choosing a start date for your new routine (think: New Year's!)</li>
			<li>Taking a picture of that new swimsuit you want to fit into in June.</li>
			<li>Paying yourself each time you workout - $1 per day can really add up fast!</li> 
		</ul>
		
		<p>Prompts and reminders are helpful to get you moving:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Set calendar reminders.</li>
			<li>Leave your workout clothes or sneakers out as a reminder.</li>
			<li>Tell a friend about your new routine - they might want to join!</li>
			<li>Create playlists to listen to while you walk, jog, or even as you get dressed for activity.</li> 
			<li>Imagine yourself at the end of your physical activity - SMILE!!!</li>
