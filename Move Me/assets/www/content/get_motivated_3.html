		<p>When was the last time you WANTED to be active, but the weather 
		outside stopped you? Or you sat down to watch TV and all the sudden it 
		was time for bed? Or you just didn’t feel like moving? These are all 
		types of low motivation zones - and you can feel really stuck in them if 
		you don’t know how to get yourself out!</p>
