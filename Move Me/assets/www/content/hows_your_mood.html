		<p>This is also a good time to review positive changes that occur after 
		exercise.</p> 
		
		<ul>
			<li>Is your mood different?</li> 
			<li>How about your reaction to stress?</li> 
			<li>Is there a change in your sense of energy?</li> 
			<li>Has your sleep quality changed?</li>
			<li>Is your concentration better?</li> 
		</ul>
		
		<p>Keep checking in with yourself - noting how physical activity is 
		working for you helps you stay motivated!</p>
