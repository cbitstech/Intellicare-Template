		<p>People commonly wait to feel motivated BEFORE they actually do 
		something, whether that’s physical activity or something else (grocery 
		shopping, calling your mother). Motivation doesn’t actually work that 
		way - you must DO and MAKE SOME PROGRESS before internal motivation 
		kicks in.</p>
