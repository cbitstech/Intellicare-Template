		<p>Another way to stay motivated is to make sure you are enjoying your 
		exercise while you are exercising. Enjoyment of physical activity is one 
		of those internal motivators we mentioned in the Goals section.</p> 

		<p>Where does your attention go during your exercise?</p> 

		<p>Part of enjoying exercise is making sure you direct your attention to 
		what is most pleasurable.</p>

		<p>Here are some examples:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Have you noticed yourself getting stronger? Walking or running 
			or playing longer?</li> 
			<li>Have you noticed you are looking forward to your physical 
			activity?</li> 
			<li>Have you noticed that making time for your activity isn't as 
			difficult as it was a couple of weeks ago?</li> 
		</ul>
