			<strong>GREAT news:</strong> You can boost your mood <em>and</em> 
			your health through regular <strong>moderate</strong> physical 
			activity! For most people a brisk walk is enough to reach moderate 
			intensity.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			How much you enjoy exercise can change with how intensely you 
			exercise. A few things to keep in mind: 
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Moderate exercise for you is the level where you can have a 
			conversation while you are active.</li>
			<li>Comfort with an exercise routine increases the chances of 
			sticking to that routine, especially when its a new routine.</li>
			<li>Increasing the intensity of your activity for short periods can 
			help you build endurance in a comfortable way.</li>
		</ul>
