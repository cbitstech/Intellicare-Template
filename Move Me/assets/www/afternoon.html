			Here are some common motivation-sapping thoughts for afternoon exercise. Have you had any of these thoughts before?
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>I am working well, I shouldn't stop</li>
			<li>I am too busy now</li>
			<li>I have to finish this now</li> 
			<li>I will get just one more thing done</li> 
			<li>I better not take a break till later</li>
			<li>I need to digest lunch first</li>
			<li>I don't have time right now</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			Remember that afternoon exercise may enhance your problem-solving levels while reducing your stress.
		</p> 

		<p>Here is some more positive self-talk instead:</p> 
		
		<ul>
			<li>I am taking a break for some activity to have a fresh mind for my afternoon job demands.</li>
			<li>I know that I feel different after exercise; let me see what work feels like under those conditions.</li>
			<li>Activity helps me manage stress and boost my mood - and is one way I am helping myself be more productive.</li>
		</ul>
