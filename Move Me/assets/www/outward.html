			As compared to searching inside, we are asking you to look outward for influences on your motivation.
		</p>

		<p>External Influence:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Motivations are influenced by a wide range of external events.</li>
			<li>For example, if a friend states a motivation (I really want to get in better shape) you may find similar motivations moving to the top of your list.</li>
			<li>Motivations are also affected by mood. If you become frustrated, motivation for whatever goal you are pursuing decreases, and other motivations compete for your attention.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			Part of success in staying motivated to exercise has to do with modifying your environment to change your motivation.
