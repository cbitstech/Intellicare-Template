			One common mistake is to think of motivation as residing in some sort of internal reservoir. This encourages one to look inward for motivation and to try to push oneself into feeling more motivated.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Repeatedly checking the gas tank of motivation to see if the dial is on full or empty.</li>
			<li>Waiting for motivation (as if it were an annoyingly late 8:15 train)</li>
			<li>Trying to dig deep to find motivation (like drilling for a new oil well, and hoping for a gusher)</li>
		<ul>

		<p>
			Relying on a sense of internal push for motivation can lead people to blame themselves as if a motivational absence was a personality flaw (I guess I am just not a motivated person…). This leads people to approach their motivation passively.
