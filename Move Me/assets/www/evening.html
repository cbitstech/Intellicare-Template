		<ul>
			<li>I am too tired</li> 
			<li>It is about to get dark</li> 
			<li>It will be too cold</li>
			<li>I just ate dinner and need to digest</li> 
			<li>I need to get to sleep early</li> 
			<li>I can just put it off until morning</li> 
		</ul>

		<p>Here are some tips and tricks to help you manage these thoughts:</p> 
		<ul>
			<li>Consider going straight to the gym from work/school.</li> 
			<li>If you go home, avoid your low motivation zones (i.e., couch, bed).</li>

			Remember that evening exercise can be a terrific way to close out the day and prepare for a relaxed and enjoyable evening.
