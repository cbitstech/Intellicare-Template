			People commonly wait to feel motivated BEFORE they actually do 
			something, whether that’s physical activity or something else 
			(grocery shopping, calling your mother). Motivation doesn't 
			actually work that way - you must DO and MAKE SOME PROGRESS before 
			internal motivation kicks in.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's better to start with something outside of yourself, initially, 
			for the energy to be physically active. For example, you could
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li> Choose a start date for your new routine (think: New Year's!)</li>
			<li>Take a picture of that new swimsuit you want to fit into in June.</li>
			<li>Pay yourself each time you workout - $1 per day can really add up fast!</li>
		</ul> 

		<p>Next, use prompts to remind yourself of these external motivators, such as:</p> 
		
		<ol>
			<li>Set calendar reminders (you can use MOVEME or your own calendar).</li>
			<li>Leave your workout clothes or sneakers out as a reminder.</li>
			<li>Tell a friend about your new routine - they might want to join!</li>
			<li>Plan to listen to your favorite audiobook or podcast while working out, or restrict your TV watching only to when you’re on a machine at the gym.</li>
			<li>Create playlists to listen to while you walk, jog, or even as you get dressed for activity.</li> 
			<li>Imagine yourself at the end of your physical activity - SMILE!!!</li>
		</ol>

		<p>And REMEMBER: a bad mood is a REASON TO exercise, not a reason to skip it!<pp>

		<p>
			Use these external motivators to get on your routine - MOVEME will teach you how to recognize the internal motivators as you move forward!
