			Habits are automatic, non-effortful, and often hard to break. Habits 
			can keep us on track when motivation lags.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Q:</strong>
			So how do you get your exercise to be more habitual?
		</p>
		 
		<p>
			<strong>A:</strong>
			 Regular practice, helped along by lots of reminders!
		</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Establish a regular time of day when you will be active.</li>
			<li>
				Keep your workout clothes and gym bag serve as reminders - put 
				them in plain view.
				
				<ol>
					<li>
						If you can, get a nice set of workout clothes that makes 
						you feel good and excited about your activity.
					</li>
					<li>
						Wear these clothes only for your activity - let the 
						clothes signal <strong>action</strong>.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				Place a note on the door (Today I'm boosting my mood with 
				activity!) or inside your athletic shoe (Wear me today for a 
				better mood).
			</li>
			<li>
				Notice yourself feeling depressed or low???

				<ol>
					<li>
						Let feelings of stress or low mood signal the perfect 
						time to exercise. Activity is a terrific response to 
						stress.
					</li>
					<li>
						Rate your mood just before and just after you are active
						 - these ratings and MoveME will remind you how well it 
						 worked for next time.
					</li>
				</ol>
