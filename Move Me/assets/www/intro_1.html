			When starting a new exercise program, it is important to remember
			to <strong>build up over time</strong>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<strong>Duration:</strong> If you have not been active for a while,
			start out slowly. Break things up into 10 to 30 minute sessions.
			Gradually add more time and days.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We suggest:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Week 1: 50 minutes total.</li>
			<li>Week 2: 100 minutes total.</li>
			<li>Week 3: 200 minutes total.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			<strong>Target:</strong> 200 minutes per week.
