			Right now, think about all the people in your life - who is good to 
			go to the movies with? Who do you want to go out with on a Friday 
			night? Who do you want to invite over for dinner? Who can you tell 
			secrets to?
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We count on different people for different things, seeking support 
			when we need it in the special ways they are good at providing. Or 
			not! Some people are in our lives and we might not be sure how they 
			serve us.
		</p> 

		<p>
			Rate the following people + or - based on whether you think they 
			influence your life in a positive way, or whether you can rely on 
			them for <strong>something</strong>&#8230; ANY kind of support. We 
			will get to <strong>how</strong> they support you later. 
		</p>
 
		<p>
			If someone ranks as a "-"  or a "?", don’t worry&#8230; it takes all
			kinds! You can always go back and re-rate them later, too.
