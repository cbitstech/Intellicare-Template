			Right now, think about all the people in your life - who is good to 
			go to the movies with? Who do you want to go out with on a Friday 
			night? Who do you want to invite over for dinner? Who can you tell 
			secrets to?
		</p>

		<p>
			Rate the people in the following list as "Positive" or "Negative" 
			based on whether you think they influence your life in a positive 
			way, or whether you can rely on them for <strong>something</strong>&#8230; 
			<strong>any</strong> kind of support. We will get to <strong>how</strong> 
			they support you later.

			You might not always know how you feel about people, you can rate 
			them as "Neutral or Don't Know". Also, feel free to skip people 
			with whom you don't have a personal relationship like business 
			contacts and service providers.
