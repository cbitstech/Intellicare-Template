			Here are some tips and tricks to starting a conversation with 
			someone - anyone you know or don't know!
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Introduce yourself, say hello!</li>
			<li>Remark on the location or the occasion, whatever you're doing</li>
			<li>Ask open-ended questions - "what do you think about [subject]?"
			    or "how was your day?"</li>
			<li>Keep the conversation going with small talk</li>
			<li>Say the other person's name now and then</li>
			<li>Use the words the other person says when making comments - if 
			    they call a marker a crayon, call it a crayon too!</li>
			<li>Use "sensing" words - "I feel you" or "I can tell" help to 
				convey that you're engaged</li>
			<li>Practice, practice, practice!</li>
		</ul>
