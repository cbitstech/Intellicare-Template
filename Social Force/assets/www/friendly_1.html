			Active listening is a process of focusing on understanding what the 
			other person is saying and communicating your understanding with 
			both verbal and nonverbal responses.
		</p>
		
		<p>Here are some helpful tips to becoming an active listener:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Make eye contact with the person you are speaking with - this 
			    will help you pay attention to the person</li>
			<li>Try to focus on what the other person is saying&#8230; not how 
			    you will respond</li>
			<li>Nod occasionally</li>
			<li>Smile! Feel free to show facial expressions</li>
			<li>Reflect on what you heard by paraphrasing, starting with a 
			    phrase like "What I'm hearing is&#8230;" or "It sounds 
			    like&#8230"</li>
			<li>Ask questions about things that are unclear</li>
			<li>Use nonjudgmental words or phrases to reflect back</li>
		</ul>
