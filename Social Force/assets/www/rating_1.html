			Right now, think about all the people in your life - who is good to 
			go to the movies with? Who do you want to go out with on a Friday 
			night? Who do you want to invite over for dinner? Who can you tell 
			secrets to?
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We count on different people for different things, seeking support 
			when we need it in the special ways they are good at providing.
