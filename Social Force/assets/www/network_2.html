			The easiest way to meet people is to do something you like doing in the 
			company of others.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Since the main focus is the activity you are doing, not just meeting 
			others, there will be less pressure on you than in a setting where the
			whole purpose is to meet people. That sounds just plain stressful!
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Even if you don't find anyone in particular that you enjoy, you will
			still have been doing something pleasant, something you like, and you
			won't feel like you wasted your time.
