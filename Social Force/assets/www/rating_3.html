			that people who support us in positive ways tend to fall in 4 
			different categories:

			<strong style="color: #669900;">Practical Support [P]</strong> - 
			Who will drive you to the hospital? Lend you money?
		</p>
		
		<p> 
			<strong style="color: #0099CC;">Advice / Information [A]</strong> - 
			Who do you go to for help when you don't know how to do something? 
			When you don't feel well? When you need help navigating a tricky 
			situation? 
		</p>

		<p> 
			<strong style="color: #9933CC;">Companionship [C]</strong> - Who do 
			you walk around a park with? Who would spend a quiet afternoon with 
			you? Who shares your tears and your joys?
		</p>

		<p> 
			<strong style="color: #CC0000;">Emotional Support [E]</strong> - Who 
			do you go to for encouragement? understanding? to share your 
			feelings? to help lift your mood?
		</p>

			Some people are great at supporting us in more ways than one - they 
			can fall into multiple categories and are probably very good friends.
