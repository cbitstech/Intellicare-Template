			Speaking with confidence means that you can communicate your wants 
			and needs in a productive manner. This takes both verbal and 
			nonverbal skill.
		</p> 

		<p>
			Body language communicates our feelings and attitudes, and projects 
			how willing we are to listen to others, all before we say the first 
			word. Body language that helps us communicate with others includes 
			<strong>SOFTEN</strong>:

		<ul>
			<li><b>S</b>miling</li>
			<li><b>O</b>pening your arms</li>
			<li>Leaning <b>F</b>orward</li>
			<li><b>T</b>ouching the other person on the arm or hand</li>
			<li><b>E</b>ye contact</li>
			<li><b>N</b>odding</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			You can do any or all of these nonverbal gestures to communicate 
			openness and confidence to another person.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			All together, your body language, tone of voice, and the words you 
			use create a picture of you as communicator. Using these gestures, a 
			light and easy tone of voice, and actively listening to someone will 
			make you seem confident even if/when you don't feel it!
