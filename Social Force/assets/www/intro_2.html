		<p><strong>Your mood and relationships with others</strong></p>
		
		<p>
			Feeling depressed or low can affect how you interact with others. It
			can affect <strong>whether</strong> you interact with others 
			<strong>or not</strong>, too. When we feel down, we are less likely 
			to socialize, and more likely to feel alone. When we isolate
			ourselves, this can greatly affect our mood - we can feel sad, lonely,
			more depressed, helpless, hopeless, and even angry.
