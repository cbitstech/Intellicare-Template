                <p><strong>What is Mantra designed to do?</strong></p>
                <p>Mantra is designed to be conceptually similar to a popular photo-pinning site. With Mantra, you can create a message you want to remember and be motivated-by, and attach photos with captions to it to keep you motivated!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>What if I forget what I am supposed to do?</strong></p>
                <p>Try hitting either the Back button, pressing on something, or long-pressing on something. Everything in Mantra is designed around these three behaviors. Also, in your web browser (e.g. Google Chrome), you can share the URL of the page you're currently on to Mantra.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>How can I add images to Mantra?</strong></p>
                <p>There are multiple ways:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Take a photo using Mantra.</li>
                        <li>Take a photo using your phone's Camera app.</li>
                        <li>Choose an image already in your image gallery.</li>
                        <li>Download images from a web page and choose one.
                            <ul>
                                <li>To do this, in your web browser (e.g. Google Chrome), use the "share" function, choose Mantra, and you'll share the page you're currently on to Mantra to download the images on the page and prompt you to choose one when it's done!</li>
                                <li>Please note that the image downloader is still pretty simple functionality and somewhat "experimental". It currently will not work with Facebook (or other sites requiring authentication to access images) or Google Images. But if the site does not require you to log-in, give it a try! <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu">Northwestern University</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/">publicdomainpictures.net</a>, <a href="http://icanhas.cheezburger.com">I Can Haz Cheezburger</a>, and <a href="http://www.pinterest.com">Pinterest</a> are known to work.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Will I be prompted to use Mantra?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes, in the Android notification tray. This will occur twice daily according to a schedule you can set in the Settings menu, as well as shortly after you take photos with the Camera app.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>How do I change the timing of the reminder?</strong></p>
                <p>In the upper-right corner of Mantra on the home screen, tap the three vertical dots, then tap "Settings", then tap on the "Start of Day" or "End of Day" options.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>How many mantras may I have?</strong></p>
                <p>As many as your phone will hold! We have not imposed our own limit.</p>
            </li>

                <p><strong>How many photos may I have for a mantra?</strong></p>
                <p>As many as your phone will hold! We have not imposed our own limit.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>How do I send suggestions or questions to the developers?</strong></p>
                <p>This can be done right from the app, via an email. Just click the menu button in the top right corner of the screen and choose "Feedback". Now just choose how you would like to send the information, type away, and send it off.</p>
