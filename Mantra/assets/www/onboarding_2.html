You'll start by writing (or selecting from our list) a mantra that fits your goals and values. You can take pictures that correspond to that mantra and add it to a collection of images corresponding to the mantra. The app will pay attention to when you take pictures and might occasionally ask you to assign these pictures to a mantra. The best way to live your mantra is to reflect on it often, this app can help you do that. At the end of each day, it will ask you to rank the apps that were most useful to you that day, use that chance to reflect on these mantras and the pictures you collected that correspond to them.
