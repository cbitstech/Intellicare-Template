			<em>Avast Ye Hearties!</em> is an app that helps you build a map of 
			places where you have fun, relax, or otherwise enjoy. When you visit
			those places, you earn Intellicare "treasure" in addition to having
			a good time.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In the upcoming screens, we'll get started by asking you about 
			where you already spend time and new sites to mark on your map.
