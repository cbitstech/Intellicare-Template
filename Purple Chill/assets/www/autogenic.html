		<h1>Autogenic Relaxation</h1>
		
		<p>
			Autogenic means something that comes from within you. In this 
			relaxation technique, you use both visual imagery and body awareness 
			to reduce stress. You repeat words or suggestions in your mind to 
			relax and reduce muscle tension. For example, you may imagine a 
			peaceful setting and then focus on controlled, relaxing breathing, 
			slowing your heart rate, or feeling different physical sensations, 
			such as relaxing each arm or leg one by one.
