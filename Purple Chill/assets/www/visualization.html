		<h1>Visualization</h1>

		<p>
			This technique encourages you to focus on a specific image or place. 
			A common visualization exercise involves imagining a relaxing place. 
			This might be a beach, or a forest, or even your own backyard. The 
			goal is to imagine this place in great detail and to incorporate all 
			five of your senses when picturing this lovely place. What would you 
			see, hear, taste, smell, and feel? The more detail you can build 
			into your visualization, the more effective it can be in helping you 
			relax.
