		<h1>Mindfulness</h1>
		
		<p>
			Mindfulness is a process of awareness that involves shifting our 
			attention in a nonjudgmental way on what is happening inside and 
			around us in the present moment. Usually we live our lives focused 
			on what will come in the future - for example with worries and 
			anxiety about what is to come, or focused on the past - for example, 
			when we are stressed, replaying mistakes and upsetting events over 
			and over in our minds. We can spend all this time looking at what 
			has not happened yet or what cannot be changed in the past while not 
			being focused on what is right before us in the present. Often we do 
			this automatically, without really paying attention to what we are 
			doing. In mindfulness, we focus only on the pleasant moment and try 
			to experience each moment in its entirety.
