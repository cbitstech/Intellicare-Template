		<h1>Sleep</h1>

		<p>
			Many people find that it takes a while to relax in bed before they  go to sleep. If you are feeling depressed or anxious, you might be having negative thoughts about sleep or other aspects of your life that make it even harder to relax, fall asleep, or stay asleep. Use these sleep relaxation exercises to help relax your body, focus your mind, and learn how to let unpleasant or negative thoughts pass instead of dwelling on them, which often keeps you awake.
