<h2>If you have...</h2>
<h3>ONE Minute</h3>
	<p> Place a hand on your stomach. On a count of three, inhale. On a count of three, exhale. Repeat for one minute. If you feel light-headed, count more slowly.</p>
	<p>Try the exercise above, but instead of counting, say, “I am” mentally as you breathe in. Then, say “At peace” as you breathe out. </p>
<h3>TWO Minutes</h3>
	<p>Count down from ten to one, slowly. As you count each number inside your head, complete a full breath cycle, in and out. Count more slowly if you begin to feel light-headed.</p> 
<h3>THREE Minutes</h3>
	<p>While sitting down, take a break
from whatever you're doing and
check your body for tension. Relax
your facial muscles and allow your
jaw to fall open slightly. Let your
shoulders drop. Let your arms fall
to your sides. Allow your hands
to loosen so that there are spaces
between your fingers. Uncross your
legs or ankles. Feel your thighs sink
into your chair, letting your legs fall
comfortably apart. Feel your shins
and calves become heavier and
your feet grow roots into the floor.
Now breathe in slowly and breathe
out slowly.</p>
<h3>FIVE Minutes</h3>
	<p>Try a self-massage. A combination
of strokes works well to relieve
muscle tension. Try gentle chops
with the edge of your hands or tapping
with fingers or cupped palms.
Put fingertip pressure on muscle
knots. Knead across muscles, and
try long, light, gliding strokes. You
can apply these strokes to any part
of the body that falls easily within
your reach. For a short session like
this, try focusing on your neck
and head.
Start by kneading the muscles
at the back of your neck and shoulders.
Make a loose fist and drum
swiftly up and down the sides and
back of your neck. Next, use your
thumbs to work tiny circles around
the base of your skull. Slowly massage
the rest of your scalp with
your fingertips. Then tap your fingers
against your scalp, moving
from the front to the back and then
over the sides.
Now massage your face. Make
a series of tiny circles with your
thumbs or fingertips. Pay particular
attention to your temples, forehead,
and jaw muscles. Use your middle
fingers to massage the bridge of
your nose and work outward over
your eyebrows to your temples.
Finally, close your eyes. Cup
your hands loosely over your face
and inhale and exhale easily for a
short while.</p>
<h3>TEN Minutes</h3>
	<p>Practice imagery.Try imagery. Start by sitting comfortably
    in a quiet room. Breathe deeply for a few minutes. 
    Now picture yourself in a place that conjures up good memories. 
    What do you smell—the heavy scent of roses on a hot day, crisp fall air, 
    the wholesome smell of baking bread?What do you hear? Drink in the colors and shapes that surround you. 
    Focus on sensory pleasures:the swoosh of a gentle wind; soft,cool grass tickling your feet; the salty smell and rhythmic beat of the ocean.
    Passively observe intrusive thoughts, and then gently disengage from them to return to the world you've created.</p>
