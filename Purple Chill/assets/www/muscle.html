		<h1>Progressive Muscle Relaxation</h1>
		
		<p>
			Ever felt like your body was more relaxed after being very 
			physically active? This technique is based on the idea that you can 
			achieve greater relaxation after you've worked a muscle than you 
			otherwise would have.</p>
			<p>PMR involves alternately tensing and relaxing 
			muscles in order to learn the process of experiencing tension and 
			then releasing it. Try moving through all the muscle groups, from 
			your face down to your feet, and purposefully tense and release each 
			muscle group. </p>
			<p>Note that, as you're focusing your attention on muscle 
			groups, your attention may also be drawn to any pain in the muscles. 
			In general, it's a good idea to skip over the muscles in any part of 
			your body that are feeling pain as well as tension.
