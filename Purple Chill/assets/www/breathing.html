		<h1>Deep Breathing</h1>
		
		<p>
			Deep breathing involves breathing from the diaphragm, the muscle you 
			hiccup with, to expand your lungs more fully than your usual 
			breathing, which expands only the chest. The best way to notice that 
			difference between deep breathing and chest breathing is to sit in a 
			comfortable position and put one hand on your chest and one hand on 
			your stomach. Slowly inhale through your nose. As you inhale, focus 
			on expanding your stomach, almost as though you're inflating a 
			balloon in your abdomen, while keeping your chest as stationary as 
			possible. The hand on your stomach should be moving in and out, 
			while the hand on your chest barely moves. Slowly exhale the breath 
			through your mouth and try again.
